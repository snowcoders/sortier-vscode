# Is this the right repo?

This project is purely just a vscode plugin for the Sortier cli. If your issue is about Sortier not sorting a file in a particular way, please open an issue against [Sortier](https://github.com/snowcoders/sortier/issues/new) and not this project.

If the issue is about running sortier via VS Code and not about an error in the actual sorting, you're probably in the right place.
